Few of the major concerns are very extremely high and low temperatures, chemical imbalances, radioactive effects etc, that led to biological transformations in the Cactoon bodies. The Melting Cact Platoon, led by Captain Candlestick, have used these adversities to their strength. The melting cactoons  let their bodies melt, thereby oozing out plasma gel, poisonous chemicals, and aquasols, that they have mutated themselves with. These melting chemicals enable them to attack their enemies by chemically combining and finally engulfing them within their bodies. Their Platoon General - Captain Candlestick, resembled a never ending melting candle, losing himself at one moment and then regenerating into someone more powerful, in the next.",
